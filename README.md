# Project Overview

This project implements two algorithms:

- An iterative and a recursive solution to generate the Fibonacci sequence.
- A recursive merge sort algorithm for sorting arrays.

The Fibonacci functions demonstrate both iterative and recursive approaches, while the merge sort function highlights recursion as a method to break down and sort arrays efficiently.
